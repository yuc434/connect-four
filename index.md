Four In A Line Rules

游戏规则❕

The Rules Are Simple
In fact, it is in the name. To win Connect Four, all you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row,
much the same as tic tac toe. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one checker
piece at a time.

四子棋游戏是在7*6的格子中。轮流从格子最上方落下棋子。棋子会落在该列格子中最下面的空格子里。先将四个棋子连成一条线（水平直线，竖直直线，或倾斜直线）者获胜，游戏结束。
