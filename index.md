Hi there, nice to meet you!

你好呀， 很高兴见到你👋


Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line, Drop Four, and 
Gravitrips (in Soviet Union)) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns
dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down,
occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by
playing the right moves.

四子棋，是黑白棋的一种。是一种益智的棋类游戏。黑红两方在6*7的格子内依次落子。黑方为先手，白方为后手。落子规则为，每一列必须从最底
下的一格开始。依此可向上一格落子。一方落子后另一方落子，依此抡次。直到游戏结束。


Four In A Line Rules

游戏规则❕

The Rules Are Simple
In fact, it is in the name. To win Connect Four, all you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row,
much the same as tic tac toe. This can be done horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Each player will drop in one checker
piece at a time.

四子棋的棋盘共有6行7列，棋盘是垂直摆放，每名玩者有21只圆形棋子，以不同颜色辨别。两名玩者轮流每次把一只棋子放进棋盘任何未全满的一行中，棋子会占据一行中最
底未被占据的位置。两名玩者任何一方先以四只棋子在横，竖或斜方向联成一条直线，便可获胜，游戏亦结束。假如棋盘已完全被棋子填满，但仍未有任何一方成功把四只棋
子成一直线，则成为和局。
